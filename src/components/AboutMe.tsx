        I am a passionate Mobile Developer with experience in building
        high-performance mobile applications using React Native and Flutter. My
        expertise lies in UI/UX design, frontend development, and mobile
        application architecture. I have worked on various SaaS platforms, POS
        systems, and e-commerce applications, focusing on delivering seamless
        user experiences.

      <p className={`mt-1 text-lg text-[#dde4ee]`}>
        While I have recently started exploring backend development, my primary
        focus remains on mobile development, where I thrive in designing and
        optimizing mobile applications. I am always eager to learn and apply new
        technologies to enhance app performance and user satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p className={`mt-1 text-lg text-[#dde4ee]`}>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, gaming, and
        continuous learning to stay ahead in the fast-paced world of mobile
        development.
